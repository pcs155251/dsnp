# FRAIG(Functionally Reduced And-Inverter Graph
## Disclaimer
This is final project of NTU dsnp course instructed by Prof. Chung-Yang (Ric) Huang. The code is based on Ric's architecture.

## Introdcution
FRAIG is a tool to simplify an And-Inverter Graph. It reduced the gate count by:
* Unused gate sweeping
* Trivial optimization
* Simplification by structural hash
* Equivalence gate merging
